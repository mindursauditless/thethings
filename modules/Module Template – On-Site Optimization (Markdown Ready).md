# On-Site Optimization Module – Audit Deliverable

---

## Summary

Critical on-page elements like title tags, H1s, and H2 structures are either missing, duplicated, misaligned with keyword targeting, or inconsistent across key service and location pages. This weakens your ability to match user search intent and can reduce click-through rates and topical clarity.

## Affected Pages / On-Page Issues

| URL | Title Tag | H1 Tag | Flag |
| --- | --------- | ------ | ---- |
| /services/hvac-repair | “Home” | “Welcome to Our Site” | No targeting |
| /services/furnace-install | Missing | “Furnace Install Services” | Missing title |
| /locations/dallas | “Dallas Plumbing Pros” | “Service in Your Area” | Weak H1 relevance |

---

## Action Plan

- Ensure every core page (services, locations) includes:
  - A unique, keyword-targeted title tag (70 characters max)
  - A single, relevant H1 that includes the service and/or location
  - Logical use of H2s to break up the page and support relevance
- Use the title to communicate both relevance and value — not just “what” but “why choose you”
- Avoid using the same H1 or title tag across multiple pages

## Templates / Tools

### Title Tag Template

`[Primary Service] in [Location] | [Brand Name or CTA]`  
**Example:** AC Repair in Dallas | Same-Day HVAC Service

### H1 Template

- Service Pages:  
  `Professional [Service Name] in [City]`

- Location Pages:  
  `Reliable [Service Category] in [Location]`

### Meta Description Prompt

Use this format to guide high-CTR meta writing:
- [Problem statement] → [Benefit of your solution] → [Clear CTA]

**Example:**  
> “AC issues ruining your comfort? Our Dallas HVAC team offers same-day repairs and 24/7 service. Call now or book online.”

### H2 Section Prompts

- “Why Our [Service] Stands Out in [City]”
- “Trusted by Local Homeowners & Businesses”
- “Common [Service] Problems We Solve”
- “Our [Service] Process, Step by Step”

## Validation & Caveats

- Use Google Search Console’s “Performance” tab to identify which pages are underperforming in clicks/impressions — weak or irrelevant title tags may be a factor
- Avoid stuffing keywords — use natural phrasing that improves clarity and trust
- Don’t use marketing fluff like “Welcome to Our Site” as H1s — lead with relevance

Fixing these on-site elements improves your visibility in search results and improves relevance signals for both users and Google.
