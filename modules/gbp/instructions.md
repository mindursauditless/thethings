# Module 4: GBP Optimization

## Purpose
Ensure Google Business Profile is complete, relevant, accurate, and aligned with on-site content—boosting local trust and relevance signals.

## Inputs Required
- Business name
- GBP primary & secondary categories
- Website URL in GBP
- Business description
- Photos (existence/recency)
- Review quantity, recency, quality
- Service area settings or address

## Philosophy
- GBP is local visibility infrastructure.
- Categories + homepage targeting must match.
- Reviews are content, not just social proof.
- Trust signals matter as much as keywords.

## OS Tone
- “Your GBP is your storefront.”
- “Category mismatch is like labeling a bakery as a laundromat.”

## MAL Crossover
- **On-Site Optimization**: Category vs. homepage mismatch
- **Service Area SEO**: Large SAB radius but no supporting content
- **Content Quality**: No local specificity → “Rewrite description.”

## Example Findings
- **Finding**: GBP links to homepage, but homepage doesn’t reference category or city.
  - **Response**: 🧱 Foundation, 📌 Must Act, 💥 High Impact → “They’re talking past each other. Fix for local relevance.”
- **Finding**: Photos are 3+ years old, only 1 review has text.
  - **Response**: 📌 Must Act, ❓ Blind Spot → “Active trust signal. Update photos, encourage detailed reviews.”

## Recommendation Tags
- 🧱 Foundation
- 📌 Must Act
- 💥 High Impact
- 🔍 Validate
- ❓ Blind Spot
- 📎 Nice to Know

## Execution Risk Notes
- Don’t suggest service area expansion if no content supports it.
- Don’t spam keywords in the description.
- Never recommend review gating or fakes.

## Future Enhancements
- Photo quality scoring
- Review keyword extraction/sentiment analysis
- SAB radius vs. competitor proximity
- GBP Insights integration
