# Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization Module – Audit Deliverable

---

## Summary

Your Google Business Profile is either incomplete, misaligned with your website, or under-leveraged. GBP is a key factor in local visibility — especially for mobile and “near me” searches. Gaps in categories, reviews, or listing structure can directly limit your local pack exposure.

## Affected Profile Gaps / Misalignments

| Area | Current State | Flag |
| --- | -------------- | ---- |
| Primary Category | “Contractor” | Too broad — should be more specific |
| Secondary Categories | None listed | Missed opportunity |
| Website Link | Points to homepage | Should point to service or location page |
| Business Description | Missing | Needs keyword-relevant copy |
| Photos | 2 generic images | Weak trust signal |
| Reviews | 14 reviews, 4.2 avg | Room for growth + replies missing |

---

## Action Plan

- Update your GBP with a more specific primary category (e.g., “HVAC Contractor”)
- Add relevant secondary categories that reflect services you want to rank for
- Link to a service or location page — not just the homepage
- Write a 750-character business description using core keywords and value propositions
- Add 5–10 real photos (team, trucks, job sites, storefronts, service work)
- Start replying to recent reviews — even brief thank-you notes build trust

## Templates / Tools

### Category Selection Guide

Use industry-specific categories based on your vertical.  
Examples for HVAC:
- HVAC Contractor (Primary)
- Air Conditioning Contractor
- Furnace Repair Service
- Heating Equipment Supplier

### GBP Description Template

“[Business Name] is a trusted [Primary Category] in [City]. We specialize in [Services]. Our team is known for [USP], and we proudly serve [Service Area]. Contact us today for [CTA or booking prompt].”

**Example:**

## Validation & Caveats

- Your GBP is not guaranteed to rank — proximity and prominence matter
- Categories must reflect real services (don’t “stuff” irrelevant ones)
- Never use stock photos — real images outperform every time
- Review management builds local authority — but don’t incentivize reviews in violation of Google policy

Optimizing your GBP is one of the most cost-effective ways to improve local map pack visibility and drive high-converting leads.
