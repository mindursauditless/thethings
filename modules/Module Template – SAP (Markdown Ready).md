# Service Area Pages (SAP) Module – Audit Deliverable

---

## Summary

Your site includes multiple service area pages targeting specific ZIP codes or towns. Many of these pages are thin, unindexed, poorly linked, or duplicative in structure. Continuing to scale this content model without validation could dilute your SEO effectiveness, waste crawl budget, or cause ranking confusion.

## Affected URLs (Review & Update)

| URL | Indexed? | Word Count | Internal Links | Action Flag |
| --- | -------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| /locations/77005 | No | 142 | 0 | Rewrite or Merge |
| /locations/77006 | No | 125 | 0 | Remove or Consolidate |
| /locations/77007 | Yes | 196 | 1 | Rewrite |
| /locations/77008 | Yes | 210 | 2 | Retain with Optimization |

## Action Plan

- Consolidate unindexed or low-value ZIP SAPs into a **regional cluster page**
- Use internal links from service pages and blog posts to drive authority to priority SAPs
- Eliminate or merge SAPs that:
  - Are unindexed
  - Have zero impressions or clicks
  - Lack unique content or purpose
- Rewrite or improve pages with thin copy, low trust signals, or generic templates
- Avoid publishing any new SAPs until:
  - Existing pages are validated and fixed
  - A scalable structure and format is established

## Templates / Tools

### ZIP Cluster Page Template

- Headline: "Serving the [Area Name] Region"
- Sections:
  - Overview of service availability
  - Short paragraphs for each ZIP (with embedded review or client mention if possible)
  - Internal jump links
  - Map embed of entire service zone
  - Call-to-action block for each ZIP or at page end

### County / City / Town Consolidation Template

- Structured format for regional page covering multiple small towns
- Include expandable list of areas served
- CTA encouraging booking by ZIP or nearest city

### SAP Decision Framework

- Only keep or create SAPs that:
  - Are indexable
  - Can be made unique
  - Match actual service areas and demand
  - Show traction in GSC or GA

### SAP Page Layout Template (Standalone)

- H1: Service + Location (e.g., "Plumbing Services in 77005")
- Sections:
  - Quick intro + CTA
  - What services are available
  - Localized proof (review, quote, etc.)
  - Why choose [Brand] in this area
  - Service map or radius mention
  - Footer CTA or sticky booking bar

### Pages to Remove / Rewrite – Review Table

| URL | Indexed? | Clicks? | Why Flagged | Suggested Action |
| --- | -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| /locations/77006 | No | 0 | Duplicate content, no traffic | Merge into ZIP cluster |
| /locations/77005 | No | 0 | No local context or structure | Remove |

### Internal Linking Prompts

- Link SAPs from:
  - City or service hubs
  - Blog posts targeting the region
- Link SAPs to:
  - Core service pages
  - Booking/contact page
  - Other nearby service areas (where relevant)

## Validation & Caveats

Before removing or consolidating SAPs:
- Confirm with GA4 or GSC that they receive zero meaningful traffic or impressions
- Pages with strong performance should not be merged or deleted — optimize instead
- Don’t rely solely on ZIP codes as a targeting strategy. Use local trust elements, customer stories, or neighborhood mentions to provide relevance
- Schema should only be used if the content on-page supports it contextually

Use this deliverable to clean up or scale your SAP strategy in a sustainable, smart way that aligns with user intent and search engine signals.
