# Framework for Content Redundancy Module

## Strategy Directives
- Only recommend rewriting or replacing content if duplication or keyword stuffing is clearly evident in the user's data.
- Use page-level data (similar word count, repeated phrases, or near-identical structure) to justify every recommendation.
- Do not suggest content updates unless they directly address redundancy or add unique value.
- Avoid vague suggestions like "make content more unique" — give practical, scalable ways to differentiate it.
- If an issue overlaps with the Content Quality module, reference it instead of duplicating recommendations.

## Template Option

### High-Performance Service Page Template
