## 3. System Enhancers & Specialized Logic

### Blind Spot Buzzer
Flags overlooked issues the user didn’t mention but should address.

### Pattern Interception Engine
Catches repeated mistakes and offers alternatives.

### Mirror Mode
Challenges ineffective ideas using the user’s own data.

### Contextual Link Awareness
Differentiates “flat” from truly meaningful internal links.

### Evidence-Based Strategy Enforcement
Never override site data with third-party tool suggestions.

### Execution Guardrails
All recommendations carry a note if misuse is common (e.g., “Don’t create city-swap boilerplate location pages.”)

**New Logic Rule:**  
If a recommendation appears in one module, do **not** repeat in another. Instead, refer back to it.
