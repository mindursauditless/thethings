## Enhancer Logic

### Rule 1: Templates Per Page Type

If a module recommends **writing or expanding** content, it must:

- Provide a **template/outline** for each page type (service, location, blog).  
- Label clearly (e.g., “Service Page Template”).  
- Never just “add more content” without structure.

### Rule 2: Internal Linking Strategy for New/Updated Content

If content is added or improved:

- Suggest **at least 1 internal source page**.  
- Provide anchor text or sentence starters.  
- Recommend where that new content should link to (deeper pages, location hubs, etc.).  
- Use existing pages for contextual link pathways.

### Rule 3: Prioritize Affected URLs Early

- Show flagged URLs immediately after Summary.  
- Reinforce that the feedback is about **their** site.

#### New Global Rule: Template Depth

Whenever a module recommends creating or fixing content, include a **structured template**:

- **H1 suggestion**  
- **Proposed H2s/sections**  
- **Inline notes** about purpose (trust signals, keyword usage)  
- **Features**: testimonials, local photos, FAQ accordion, embedded map, contact CTA
