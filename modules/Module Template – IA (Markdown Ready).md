# Information Architecture (IA) Module – Audit Deliverable

---

## Summary

Your website’s current structure lacks clarity and logical grouping, making it difficult for users and search engines to understand what services you offer, where you offer them, and how to access them. Poor IA can reduce crawl efficiency, dilute internal authority signals, and frustrate visitors.

## Affected URLs / Navigation Issues

| Issue | Example | Flag |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Services buried in dropdowns | /services/hvac buried under "Our Work" | Hard to discover |
| Location pages not grouped | /austin, /dallas, /houston | No hub or structure |
| Duplicate nav items | "Moving Services" and "Movers" | UX confusion |
| Missing top nav links | No "Service Areas" or "Locations" page | Navigation gap |

---

## Action Plan

- Create or restructure your navigation to include clear categories:
  - Primary: Services, Locations, About, Contact
  - Secondary: Blog, Reviews, Careers (if needed)
- Group services logically (e.g., HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing) and assign hub pages if service list exceeds 5–7
- Add a central “Locations” or “Service Areas” hub to link out to each city/region page
- Flatten nested menus where possible (ideally ≤2 levels deep)
- Ensure URLs reflect structural logic and are not random (e.g., /services/plumbing vs. /our-products/page-2)

## Templates / Tools

### Sample Navigation Layout

**Main Nav Example (Multi-Service, Multi-Location):**

- Home
- Services
  - Heating & Cooling
  - Electrical
  - Plumbing
- Locations
  - Dallas
  - Fort Worth
  - Arlington
- About
- Contact

### Hub Page Template

Used when you have too many child pages to include directly in the nav.

**Example:**  
**/services/** → Contains links to:
- /services/heating
- /services/cooling
- /services/air-quality

**Hub Page Should Include:**
- Intro paragraph explaining what’s grouped here
- Visual links/cards
- CTA to request a quote or service

### URL Structure Cheat Sheet

| Page Type | Recommended Format |
| --- | --- |
| Service Page | /services/[service-name] |
| Location Page | /locations/[city-name] |
| Blog Post | /blog/[post-title] |
| Hub Page | /services/ or /locations/ |

## Validation & Caveats

- Avoid changing URL paths without proper 301 redirects
- Do not create overlapping categories in nav (e.g., “Our Services” and “Solutions”)
- Keep nav focused on discovery — remove vanity pages unless they serve a conversion or relevance purpose
- Use analytics or heatmaps to determine if users are engaging with your current nav

Fixing IA increases clarity, crawlability, and conversion flow — especially for users entering on deep service or blog pages.
