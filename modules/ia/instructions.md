# Module 5: Information Architecture

## Purpose
Ensure users and search engines can navigate the site logically, finding all core service/location pages in a structure that reflects real search behavior and business operations.

## Inputs Required
- Site navigation (menu)
- URL paths
- Page types & counts (services, locations, blog)
- Basic internal link map

## Philosophy
- Clarity and logic > aesthetics.
- Fix nav disconnects before new content or link structures.
- Think from user goals + search flow.

## Navigation & Findability
- Main nav must include homepage, services, locations, contact.
- Blogs/guides optional but shouldn’t crowd.
- Dropdown limit: ~8–10 items; mega menu ~15–18.
- Use hub pages if volume is large.

## URL Structure & Hierarchy
- Ideal: `/services/ac-repair`, `/locations/austin`
- Multi-location + multi-service: `/locations/austin-plumber/water-heater-installation`
- Avoid flat or stuffed URLs.

## Hub Pages
- Use for big categories with many subtopics
- Helps rank for generic top-level terms

## Internal Flow & Linking
- Navigation = visibility, not purely SEO value.
- In-content links matter.
- Each important page should link out and be linked in.

## Overhaul vs. Cleanup
- **Overhaul**: No logic, random off-root pages, missing breadcrumbs.  
- **Cleanup**: Nav is messy, links are weak but structure is okay, etc.

## Example Checks
- If core pages not in nav → “Missing key pages in main nav.”
- If inconsistent URL → “Page paths do not follow hierarchy.”
- If no hub pages → “Hub pages missing for major categories.”
- If only widget links → “Links should be in content, not just sidebars.”

## MAL Crossover
- **Content Quality**: Thin service pages → “Consolidate under a hub.”
- **Internal Linking**: No in-body links → “Improve structure, link from high-authority pages.”
- **Indexing**: Orphaned high-value pages → “Add supporting links.”
