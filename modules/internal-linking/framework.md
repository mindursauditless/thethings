# Framework for Internal Linking Module

## Strategy Directives
- Prioritize increasing internal links to key conversion pages: Service, Location, and Menu/Category pages.
- Identify important pages with very few internal links — especially if they are not represented in navigation or body copy.
- Avoid "flat" structures where About or Blog pages receive the same or more links than core business pages.
- Focus on internal links that occur *within the body* of content, not just nav or footer.
- Provide scalable, user-friendly internal linking strategies — never force links or add them where they feel unnatural.

If a useful insight can be logically inferred from patterns in the data (e.g. repeated structures, high frequency, consistent gaps), you're allowed to do so — but be transparent.

Avoid making guesses about missing information. If a data point is missing, describe the implications of that absence or recommend how it could be collected.

These templates should be added to the overall report. You are helping build the full report and we want to provide real actionable insights. We don't want lame obvious recommendations like you need more content on your thin pages.... give them actual guidance on what the pages should look like, what should be the focus/target of those pages, what the benefit/impact would be of improving them and use specific examples.

Our goal isn't to repeat issues they already know about from the csv data... We want to provide actual insights and recommendations.

## Template Option

### Scalable Internal Linking Recommendations  
Use these tactics when linking to SAPs or service pages.

```
**Modular Ways to Add Internal Links**
- Add a list of “Other Locations We Serve” with links to nearby city pages at the bottom of each SAP.
- On service pages, link to complementary services (e.g., Fence Installation → Fence Repair).
- Include FAQ accordions that reference other services or locations naturally.
- Create a “Featured Services in [City]” block in sidebar or mid-content.

**Anchor Text Ideas**
- Fence Installation in [City]
- Our [City] Fence Repair Services
- Serving [Nearby City], [City], and More
- Compare Fence Services in [City]
- Learn More About [Service] in [City]
```

## Output Format
1. Summary (why this matters for crawl depth, hierarchy, and ranking)
2. Affected URLs (receiving too few internal links)
3. Action Plan (2–5 steps, include where links can be added and to what pages)
4. Tools/Templates (insert suggestions **only if link gaps exist**)
5. Validation Notes (e.g., use crawl maps or internal link counts)
