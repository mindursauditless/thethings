# Framework for Internal Linking Module

## Strategy Directives
- Prioritize increasing internal links to key conversion pages: Service, Location, and Menu/Category pages.
- Identify important pages with very few internal links — especially if they are not represented in navigation or body copy.
- Avoid "flat" structures where About or Blog pages receive the same or more links than core business pages.
- Provide scalable, user-friendly internal linking strategies — never force links or add them where they feel unnatural.

## Template Option

### Scalable Internal Linking Recommendations  
Use these tactics when linking to SAPs or service pages.

```
**Modular Ways to Add Internal Links**
- Add a list of “Other Locations We Serve” with links to nearby city pages at the bottom of each SAP.
- On service pages, link to complementary services (e.g., Fence Installation → Fence Repair).
- Include FAQ accordions that reference other services or locations naturally.
- Create a “Featured Services in [City]” block in sidebar or mid-content.

**Anchor Text Ideas**
- Fence Installation in [City]
- Our [City] Fence Repair Services
- Serving [Nearby City], [City], and More
- Compare Fence Services in [City]
- Learn More About [Service] in [City]
```
