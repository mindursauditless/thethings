# Internal Linking Module – Audit Deliverable

---

## Summary

Your current internal linking structure lacks the consistency and intent needed to support content hierarchy, search relevance, and crawl efficiency. Service and location pages are often isolated or buried, and blog content is under-leveraged as a source of contextual signals.

## Affected Pages / Link Coverage Gaps

| URL | Incoming Links | Outgoing Links | Indexed? | Flag |
| --- | --------------- | --------------- | -------- | ---- |
| /services/hvac-installation | 0 | 1 | Yes | Orphaned |
| /blog/ac-tips | 1 | 0 | Yes | Missed link opportunity |
| /locations/houston | 2 | 0 | Yes | Add links to relevant services |

---

## Action Plan

- Ensure every service and location page is linked from:
  - Main navigation OR
  - A hub page (services or locations)
- Link blog content contextually to service or location pages
- Audit all “orphan” pages (0 internal links pointing to them)
- Standardize internal linking across templates so every new page includes 1–2 strategic links
- Use descriptive anchor text that reflects page purpose (avoid "click here")

### Internal Link Strategy Guide

| Page Type | Should Link To | Should Receive Links From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service Page | Location pages, related services, blog | Hub pages, blog posts |
| Location Page | Services in that area, contact page | Location hub, service pages |
| Blog Post | Related services, location pages | Home page (if evergreen), other blogs |

### Sentence Starter Examples (Blog > Services)

- “If your AC is blowing hot air, you might need our [AC repair service].”
- “Learn more about our [electrical safety inspections] offered in Houston.”
- “Residents in [Austin] can book same-day service through our [local team].”

### Internal Link Checklist (for Writers/Editors)

- [ ] Does this page link to at least 2 relevant internal pages?
- [ ] Are anchor texts natural and informative?
- [ ] Is the page being linked *to* from at least 1 hub or contextual page?
- [ ] Have we avoided linking to non-SEO pages (e.g., login, cart)?

## Validation & Caveats

- Internal links should add value — don’t force them unnaturally just for SEO
- Avoid sitewide footers with hundreds of links (dilutes authority)
- Use crawl tools to verify crawl paths and ensure orphaned pages can be discovered
- Internal links are a powerful signal for relevance and priority — treat them like strategy, not decoration

Fixing internal linking boosts topical relevance, crawlability, and user pathing — and helps your best pages get found faster.
