# Module 10: Internal Linking

## Purpose
Optimize internal links to reinforce topical authority, improve crawlability, and guide user flow—beyond just being "1 click away from the homepage."

## Primary Checks

| Check             | Method                         | Output                                                       |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Orphaned pages    | Page list vs. link map         | Flag pages that no internal pages link to                   |
| Nav-only links    | Present but not contextual      | Mark as "flat, not strategic"                               |
| Supporting content links | Do blogs/guides link to services? | If not, we lose synergy                                    |
| Link anchor relevance | Evaluate anchor text usage  | Flag generic or irrelevant anchors                          |
| Link placement    | In-body vs. sidebar/footer      | In-body > boilerplate links                                 |

## Crossover issues
- **Content Quality**: Blog pages not linking to relevant services → “Add internal CTAs/links.”
- **IA**: Key pages not linked beyond nav → “Needs in-body linking strategy.”
- **Indexing**: Page not indexed + no links → “Invisible to Google.”
- **Content Redundancy**: Duplicate topics that never link → “Merge or cross-link.”

## Recommendation Tags
- 📌 Must Act → flat structures or orphaned pages
- 🧠 Strategic Fix → create content templates with built-in links
- ❓ Blind Spot → “Everything’s 1 click away”—still lacks context
- 🔍 Validate → questionable anchor strategies

## Example Reactions
- **Finding**: Location pages only in a dropdown, no cross-links from services or blogs.
  - **Response**: 📌 Must Act, 🧠 Strategic Fix → “They’re technically visible but functionally weak. Add context links.”
- **Finding**: Service pages in nav/homepage, but no supporting content references them.
  - **Response**: ❓ Blind Spot → “Visibility ≠ integration. You need contextual signals.”

## Internal Linking Logic Correction
- “Flat structure ≠ effective structure. Use in-body links between related services, locations, and content.”
