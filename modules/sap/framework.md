# Framework for Service Area Pages (SAP) Module

## Strategy Directives
- Focus on identifying issues related to service area pages (SAPs), including:
  - Overgeneration (too many SAPs with little/no differentiation)
  - Irrelevant city targeting
  - Underperforming pages (thin content, no traffic, poor targeting)
- Recommend consolidation or removal *only* when supported by ranking or engagement data.
- Call out poor formatting or boilerplate content.
- Avoid recommending the creation of SAPs unless a clear pattern or demand exists.
- Offer structural and content-based guidance to improve existing SAPs — no generic “add content” advice.

## Template Option

### SAP Content Outline Template  
Use this when SAPs are underperforming, duplicated, or need rewriting.
