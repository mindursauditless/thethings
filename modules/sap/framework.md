# Framework for Service Area Pages (SAP) Module

## Strategy Directives
- Focus on identifying issues related to service area pages (SAPs), including:
  - Overgeneration (too many SAPs with little/no differentiation)
  - Irrelevant city targeting
  - Underperforming pages (thin content, no traffic, poor targeting)
- Recommend consolidation or removal *only* when supported by ranking or engagement data.
- Call out poor formatting or boilerplate content.
- Avoid recommending the creation of SAPs unless a clear pattern or demand exists.
- Offer structural and content-based guidance to improve existing SAPs — no generic “add content” advice.

- - If a useful insight can be logically inferred from patterns in the data (e.g. repeated structures, high frequency, consistent gaps), you're allowed to do so — but be transparent.

Avoid making guesses about missing information. If a data point is missing, describe the implications of that absence or recommend how it could be collected.

These templates should be added to the overall report. You are helping build the full report and we want to provide real actionable insights. We don't want lame obvious recommendations like you need more content on your thin pages.... give them actual guidance on what the pages should look like, what should be the focus/target of those pages, what the benefit/impact would be of improving them and use specific examples.

Our goal isn't to repeat issues they already know about from the csv data... We want to provide actual insights and recommendations.

## Template Option
