## Strategy Directives

Focus on identifying issues related to service area pages (SAPs), including:
- Overgeneration (too many SAPs with little/no differentiation)
- Irrelevant city targeting
- Underperforming pages (thin content, no traffic, poor targeting)

If SAPs appear weak or duplicated, call out:
- Thin content
- Poor formatting or boilerplate structure
- Lack of regional targeting

For existing SAPs:
- Offer structure and content-based suggestions
- Focus on what makes a page useful and relevant
- Avoid general advice like “add more content” — be specific with examples

When possible, draw insights from patterns (e.g. repeated headings, empty pages, keyword overlap) — but do not make assumptions.
