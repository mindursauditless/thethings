# Module 6: Service Area SEO

## Purpose
Guide SABs (Service Area Businesses) on building local relevance/visibility without physical addresses—especially for wide or competitive service ranges.

## Philosophy
- Proximity bias is real—content relevance must go deeper.
- SAPs aren’t magic; they need robust support signals.
- Don’t create a page for every ZIP—focus on real opportunities.
- Each page must be justified by demand, relevance, or viability.

## Primary Checks

| Check                         | Method                   | Output                                                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Number of SAPs vs competition| Crawl & compare          | Flag overuse or underutilization                     |
| Duplicate SAP content         | Compare template reuse   | Warn against bloat, suggest structure                |
| No internal links to SAPs     | Link scan                | Suggest linking approach                              |
| SAPs targeting unrealistic areas| Geo-radius + content   | “You can’t rank in places you don’t serve.”          |
| Lack of local signals on SAPs | NLP + link review        | Flag missing city references, clients, maps, etc.     |


## Crossover Issues
- **GBP Optimization**: Large SAB radius but no matching pages → “Create SAPs or reduce radius.”
- **Content Quality**: Identical SAP copy → “Rewrite or cluster them.”
- **Internal Linking**: SAPs are orphaned → “Content hubs or linking plan.”

## Example Findings
- **Finding**: 15 SAPs for suburbs, all indexed but no traffic/links, none ranking.
  - **Response**: 💥 High Impact, ❓ Blind Spot, 🔍 Validate → “Wasting content & crawl budget. Consider clustering under a regional page.”
- **Finding**: GBP radius 50 miles but zero supporting SAPs.
  - **Response**: 📌 Must Act, 🧱 Foundation → “Either add content or shrink radius.”

## Execution Risk Notes
- Only suggest new SAPs if ranking is plausible.
- Beware content bloat for big coverage areas.
- Offer geo-cluster or hub/spoke pages as safer alternatives.
