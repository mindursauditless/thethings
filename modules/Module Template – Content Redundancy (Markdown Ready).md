# Content Redundancy & Cannibalization Module – Audit Deliverable

---

## Summary

Multiple pages on your site appear to target the same or overlapping keywords, serve the same user intent, or use nearly identical content templates. This creates redundancy, splits authority, and may lead to Google ranking none of the pages well.

---

## Affected Pages / Overlap Map

| Page A | Page B | Keyword / Intent Overlap | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| /services/ac-repair | /ac-repair | “ac repair near me” | Merge or Redirect |
| /blog/ac-tips | /blog/ac-checklist | Seasonal AC help | Combine |
| /locations/dallas | /locations/dallas-hvac | HVAC in Dallas | Consolidate under one page |

---

## Action Plan

- Identify clusters of redundant or overlapping pages
- Decide whether to:
  - Merge: combine content into one stronger page
  - Redirect: 301 one to the other, based on performance
  - Rewrite: make the page more unique in scope or intent
- Use keyword mapping to ensure each URL targets a distinct query or topic
- Update internal links and sitemaps to reflect new preferred URLs

### Page Consolidation Decision Guide

| Trigger | Recommended Action |
| --- | --------------------- |
| Duplicate title/H1 | Rewrite or Merge |
| Competing for same query | Merge + 301 |
| One page performs, one does not | Keep top performer, redirect other |
| Both pages weak | Merge + rewrite |

### Query Mapping Worksheet

- List all key queries you want to rank for
- Assign a unique preferred URL to each
- Flag overlaps and resolve before creating new content

### Pruning Audit Table

| URL | Indexed? | Traffic? | Query Target | Keep? | Action |
| --- | -------- | -------- | -------------| ------| ------ |
| /ac-repair | Yes | 50 visits/mo | “ac repair near me” | ✅ | Primary |
| /services/ac-repair | Yes | 12 visits/mo | Same | ❌ | Redirect to /ac-repair |

## Validation & Caveats

- Use GA4, GSC, and tools like Ahrefs or Semrush to determine:
  - Which page gets more traffic or backlinks
  - Which URL is ranking more consistently
- Avoid over-pruning — thin content is not the same as duplicate content
- Never remove pages without redirecting if they’ve been indexed

Resolving cannibalization and redundancy strengthens topical authority, improves UX, and increases your ability to rank more consistently with less effort.
