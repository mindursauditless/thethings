## Validation & Caveats

Before removing or rewriting any content:

- Confirm with GA4 and GSC whether the page has traffic or impression history
- High-performing pages may only need optimization — not full rewrites
- Avoid over-optimization by repeating keywords unnaturally or duplicating other service pages

Use this module’s guidance to create content that ranks and converts — by proving relevance, trust, and value in every section.
