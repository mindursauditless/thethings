# Framework for Content Quality Module

## Strategy Directives
- try to avoid recommend content updates unless there is clear evidence of thin content, missing headers, extremely poor performance, off-topic text, or duplicate patterns.
- Never suggest generic improvements like “add more content.” Instead, specify exactly what content is missing and why it matters.
- Base every recommendation on real user data from the CSV (e.g., low word count, irrelevant text, missing H1, etc.)
- we're focusing on services, locations, homepage, menu page, the most important pages for gaining customers or leads.

- If a useful insight can be logically inferred from patterns in the data (e.g. repeated structures, high frequency, consistent gaps), you're allowed to do so — but be transparent.

Avoid making guesses about missing information. If a data point is missing, describe the implications of that absence or recommend how it could be collected.

These templates should be added to the overall report. You are helping build the full report and we want to provide real actionable insights. We don't want lame obvious recommendations like you need more content on your thin pages.... give them actual guidance on what the pages should look like, what should be the focus/target of those pages, what the benefit/impact would be of improving them and use specific examples.

Our goal isn't to repeat issues they already know about from the csv data... We want to provide actual insights and recommendations.
