# Framework for Content Quality Module

## Strategy Directives
- Do not recommend content updates unless there is clear evidence of thin content, missing headers, extremely poor performance, off-topic text, or duplicate patterns.
- Never suggest generic improvements like “add more content.” Instead, specify exactly what content is missing and why it matters.
- Base every recommendation on real user data from the CSV (e.g., low word count, irrelevant text, missing H1, etc.)
- we're focusing on services, locations, homepage, menu page, the most important pages for gaining customers or leads.

## Template Option

### High-Performance Service Page Template  
Use this if the user’s data shows a service or SAP page needs a revamp. Use a similar template for local businesses that are not service-based. Just make thos more industry-specific
