# Module 3: On-Site Optimization

## Purpose
Ensure each page clearly signals its purpose to users/search engines—using strategic page titles, H1s, meta descriptions, and header structure.

## Primary Checks

| Check                                      | Method               | Output                                           |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Title includes keyword+location            | NLP/pattern match    | Flag missing intent signals                      |
| H1 reinforces primary keyword+local mod    | Header parsing       | Highlight vague/generic H1s                     |
| Meta description = value prop, not fluff   | NLP + CTA check      | Flag passive/empty copy                         |
| Redundant heading usage                    | H2/H3 structure check| Flag overuse of keyword variants                |
| Inconsistent/conflicting title/H1          | Side-by-side logic   | Flag mismatch/confusion risk                    |

## Condition & Flag Examples
- H1 = “Welcome/Home” → ❌ Poor targeting → 📌 Must Act
- H1 stuffed → ⚠ Risk → Possibly 📌 Must Act
- H1 duplicates → 🔍 Validate
- Good H1 → “Nice to Know”

## Crossover Issues
- **Content Quality**: Weak H1 + generic body → “Rewrite page holistically.”
- **GBP Optimization**: GBP category ≠ homepage targeting → “Alignment issue.”
- **Schema**: Page lacks identity → “Add schema after titles fixed.”

## Example Findings
- **Finding**: H1 = “Welcome to Our Website” / Title = “Home”
  - **Response**: 🧱 Foundation, 📌 Must Act → “Tells Google nothing. Include core service, brand, location.”
- **Finding**: Blog titles are clear but duplicates in phrasing
  - **Response**: 📎 Nice to Know → “Vary phrasing for broader queries, avoid cannibalization.”

## Recommendation Tags
- 🧱 Foundation
- 📌 Must Act
- 💥 High Impact
- 🔍 Validate
- ❓ Blind Spot
- 📎 Nice to Know

## Execution Risk Notes to Provide User
- Don’t change titles without checking current ranking/traffic.
- Careful rewriting if a page is performing well.
- Don’t obsess over pixel length—focus on clarity/intent.
