# Framework for Onsite Optimization Module

## Strategy Directives
- Focus only on the pages that matter for customer acquisition: service pages, location pages, the homepage, and menu/category pages.
- Evaluate whether each important page is competitive for its core commercial keywords.
- Flag issues like:
  - Missing or duplicate H1s
  - Weak or missing title tags
  - Pages with misaligned or off-topic optimization
- Ensure the title tag and H1 both reinforce the target keyword and location.
